#   Note: I don't see how one can specify the 'user' for the
#         Actions runs so I don't see the value of creating
#         a non-root user when the container is built.

# This Github Actions page notes:
#   o  Using CODEOWNERS to monitor changes: specifically changes to.github/workflows/*
#   o  Preventing GitHub Actions from creating or approving pull requests
# Security notes:
#   o  secure the docker container against meddling
#   o  secure the monocle3 repository against meddling
