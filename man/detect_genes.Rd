\title{Detects genes above minimum threshold.}
\usage{
detect_genes(cds, min_expr = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{Input cell_data_set object.}

\item{min_expr}{Expression threshold}
}
\value{
Updated cell_data_set object
}
\description{
For each feature in a cell_data_set object, detect_genes counts
how many cells are expressed above a minimum threshold. In addition, for
each cell, detect_genes counts the number of genes above this threshold are
detectable. Results are added as columns num_cells_expressed and
num_genes_expressed in the rowData and colData tables respectively.

\dontrun{
HSMM <- detect_genes(HSMM, min_expr=0.1)
